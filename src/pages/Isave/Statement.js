      <p>
        The Fintech industry is ever increasing in Africa but little focus has been paid to savings and investments platforms which means the public isnt used to them and doubt the advantages of such platforms.
        Most people and establishments prefer the use of banks to save their funds which secure but provide little or no interest on the funds. The goal is to attract target users from bank saving to the Isave app.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>User research done</strong> in line with personalities in the user personas led to the discovery of some major challenges that the Isave app needs to solve for wide adoption and smooth user experience.
